-- In this SQL, I'm querying a database (dannys_diner) with 3 datasets (sales, menu, members) to provide insights on Danny's customer loyalty program.

-- Data set:
CREATE TABLE sales (
  "customer_id" VARCHAR(1),
  "order_date" DATE,
  "product_id" INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO sales
  ("customer_id", "order_date", "product_id")
VALUES
  ('A', '2021-01-01', '1'),
  ('A', '2021-01-01', '2'),
  ('A', '2021-01-07', '2'),
  ('A', '2021-01-10', '3'),
  ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
  ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
  ('B', '2021-01-01', '2'),

CREATE TABLE menu (
  "product_id" INTEGER,
  "product_name" VARCHAR(5),
  "price" INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO menu
  ("product_id", "product_name", "price")
VALUES
  ('1', 'sushi', '10'),
  ('2', 'curry', '15'),
  ('3', 'ramen', '12');
  

CREATE TABLE members (
  "customer_id" VARCHAR(1),
  "join_date" DATE
);

INSERT INTO members
  ("customer_id", "join_date")
VALUES
  ('A', '2021-01-07'),
  ('B', '2021-01-09');

Bonus Questions:
1. Recreate the following table output using the available data:
SELECT sales.customer_id, sales.order_date, menu.product_name, menu.price,
CASE WHEN members.join_date<=sales.order_date THEN 'Y'
    ELSE 'N'
    END AS member
FROM dannys_diner.sales sales
JOIN dannys_diner.menu menu on menu.product_id=sales.product_id
LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.members members on members.customer_id=sales.customer_id;

2. Rank customer purchases by member status.
SELECT *,
CASE WHEN member='Y' THEN RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id, member ORDER BY order_date)
    ELSE 'null'
    END AS ranking
FROM
(
SELECT sales.customer_id, sales.order_date, menu.product_name, menu.price,
CASE WHEN members.join_date<=sales.order_date THEN 'Y'
    ELSE 'N'
    END AS member
FROM dannys_diner.sales sales
JOIN dannys_diner.menu menu on menu.product_id=sales.product_id
LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.members members on members.customer_id=sales.customer_id
) AS customer_data;

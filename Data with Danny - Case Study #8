-- A. Data Exploration and Cleansing
-- 1. Update the fresh_segments.interest_metrics table by modifying the month_year column to be a date data type
  with the start of the month

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS interest_metrics_cleaned
CREATE TABLE interest_metrics_cleaned AS
SELECT month_year, interest_id, composition, index_value, ranking, percentile_ranking,
year ||'-'|| month ||'-'|| day AS date
FROM
(
SELECT *, substr(new_date, 7) AS year, substr(new_date, 4, 2) AS month, substr(new_date, 1, 2) AS day
FROM
(
SELECT *, '01' ||'-'|| month_year AS new_date
FROM interest_metrics
) AS data
) AS data2;
------------
SELECT *,
    CASE WHEN month_year IS NOT NULL THEN 1
    ELSE 0
    END AS new_date
FROM interest_metrics;
--
substr(month_date, 4) ||'-'|| substr(month_date, 1, 2) ||'-01'||

-- 2. What is count of records in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics for each month_year value sorted in chronological order
  (earliest to latest) with the null values appearing first?
What do you think we should do with these null values in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics
How many interest_id values exist in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics table but not in the fresh_segments.interest_map table? What about the other way around?
Summarise the id values in the fresh_segments.interest_map by its total record count in this table
What sort of table join should we perform for our analysis and why? Check your logic by checking the rows where interest_id = 21246 in your joined output and include all columns from fresh_segments.interest_metrics and all columns from fresh_segments.interest_map except from the id column.
Are there any records in your joined table where the month_year value is before the created_at value from the fresh_segments.interest_map table? Do you think these values are valid and why?
